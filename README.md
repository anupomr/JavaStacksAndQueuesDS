<h3> Assignment 4 Q 1</h3>
Implement a method with signature concatenate(LinkedQueue<E> Q2) for the LinkedQueue<E> class that takes all elements of Q2 and appends them to the end of the original queue. The operation should run in O(1) time and should result in Q2 being an empty queue. Write the necessary code to test the method. Hint: You may just modify the SinglyLinkedList class to add necessary support.
